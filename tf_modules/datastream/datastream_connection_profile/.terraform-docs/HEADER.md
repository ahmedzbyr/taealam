# Datastream Connection Profiles

Datastream is a user-friendly and serverless change data capture (CDC) and replication service designed to enable dependable data synchronization with minimal latency.

The creation of connection profiles is essential for Datastream to facilitate the seamless transfer of data from source databases to the intended destinations.

This module allows us to establish connection profiles for a variety of source types, including:

- Oracle
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets
- BigQuery

These connection profiles serve as the bridge for Datastream to efficiently capture and replicate data across different platforms and systems.
