Using Ansible in the init script of a Google Compute Engine (GCE) instance can be a powerful way to automate the configuration and setup of your virtual machines. Here are the general steps to achieve this:

1. **Install Ansible**: Ensure Ansible is installed on your GCE instance. You can use a startup script to install Ansible during instance initialization. For example, you can use a startup script like this in the instance creation:

   ```shell
   #!/bin/bash
   apt-get update
   apt-get install -y ansible
   ```

   This script will run when the instance starts up and will install Ansible.

2. **Create an Ansible Playbook**: Write an Ansible playbook that defines the tasks you want to execute on the GCE instance. For example, you might want to install software, configure system settings, or deploy applications. Save this playbook as a YAML file (e.g., `my_playbook.yml`).

   ```yaml
   ---
   - name: Configure GCE Instance
     hosts: localhost
     tasks:
       - name: Ensure a package is installed
         apt:
           name: nginx
           state: present
       - name: Copy a configuration file
         copy:
           src: /path/to/local/config.conf
           dest: /etc/nginx/config.conf
   ```

3. **Upload Playbook to the Instance**: You can upload the Ansible playbook to your GCE instance using various methods. Here are a few options:

   - Use `gcloud compute scp` command to copy the playbook to the instance from your local machine.
   - Store the playbook in a Google Cloud Storage bucket and use `gsutil` to download it on the instance.
   - Include the playbook content directly in your init script.

4. **Modify the Init Script**: In your GCE instance, modify the init script that runs during instance creation. You can do this when creating the instance or by editing the metadata of an existing instance. Here's an example of an init script that runs Ansible:

   ```shell
   #!/bin/bash
   apt-get update
   apt-get install -y ansible
   
   # Download the Ansible playbook
   gsutil cp gs://your-bucket/my_playbook.yml /tmp/my_playbook.yml
   
   # Run Ansible playbook
   ansible-playbook /tmp/my_playbook.yml
   ```

   Make sure to replace `gs://your-bucket/my_playbook.yml` with the correct path to your playbook file.

5. **Launch the GCE Instance**: Create or restart your GCE instance with the modified init script. When the instance boots up, it will install Ansible and execute the playbook you specified.

6. **Monitoring and Troubleshooting**: Keep an eye on the instance initialization process to ensure everything runs smoothly. You can check logs and outputs to troubleshoot any issues with the init script or Ansible playbook execution.

This approach allows you to use Ansible for configuration management and automation during the initialization of your GCE instances. It's particularly useful for setting up instances consistently and ensuring that they meet your desired configuration.
