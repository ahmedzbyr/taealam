GCP Datastream is a serverless Change Data Capture (CDC) and replication service provided by Google Cloud Platform. It is designed to simplify the synchronization of data across different databases and applications. Here are some key points regarding GCP Datastream:

1. **Serverless and Easy to Use**: GCP Datastream is a serverless service, meaning that you don't need to manage any server infrastructure to use it. It's also designed to be user-friendly, making it easy to set up and manage data synchronization tasks.

2. **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: One of the core functionalities of GCP Datastream is Change Data Capture (CDC). This feature captures and tracks changes in your databases, enabling you to keep your data synchronized across different systems.

3. **Data Replication**: Besides capturing changes, GCP Datastream also facilitates data replication. This is particularly useful for replicating Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) data in databases like MySQL into Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) databases such as BigQuery, supporting a wide range of use cases including analytics and machine learning.

4. **Synchronization Across Heterogeneous Databases**: With GCP Datastream, you can synchronize data across multiple different databases and applications reliably. This is crucial for organizations that operate with a diverse set of databases and need to ensure data consistency across them.

5. **Integration with Other GCP Services**: Datastream is built to work seamlessly with other Google Cloud Platform services, which can be advantageous when building data pipelines or analytics setups on GCP.
