##Â Testing Export Python Code 


```python
# Importing required libraries
import base64  # Importing base64 library for encoding/decoding operations
from unittest.mock import Mock  # Importing Mock from unittest.mock for creating mock objects

import ds_export_cf  # Importing the module under test

# Creating a mock object for context which would be used to simulate Cloud Function's context
mock_context = Mock()
mock_context.event_id = "617187464135194"  # Assigning a mock event_id to the context
mock_context.timestamp = "2020-04-15T22:09:03.761Z"  # Assigning a mock timestamp to the context

def test_datastore_export(capsys):  # Defining the test function, capsys is a pytest fixture capturing stdout and stderr

    bucket = "gs://my-bucket"  # Specifying the Google Cloud Storage bucket where exported data will be stored
    json_string = '{{ "bucket": "{bucket}" }}'.format(bucket=bucket)  # Formatting JSON string to include bucket info

    data = bytes(json_string, "utf-8")  # Encoding JSON string to bytes
    data_encoded = base64.b64encode(data)  # Base64 encoding the data
    event = {"data": data_encoded}  # Creating an event dict with encoded data

    mockDatastore = Mock()  # Creating a mock object for Datastore client
    ds_export_cf.client = mockDatastore  # Replacing the client in ds_export_cf with the mock object

    ds_export_cf.datastore_export_entities(event, mock_context)  # Calling the function under test with mock objects
    out, err = capsys.readouterr()  # Capturing stdout and stderr

    export_args = mockDatastore.export_entities.call_args[1]  # Retrieving the arguments with which export_entities was called

    assert export_args["request"].output_url_prefix == bucket  # Asserting that the bucket in request args is as expected
```

Explanation:
1. **`base64.b64encode(data)`**: This method encodes the given data using Base64 encoding scheme. More info can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html#base64.b64encode). This is what the cloud schedular would pass the information to the Pubsub, which is then forwarded to the cloud schedular in this format. We are encoding and decoding it here. 
2. **`unittest.mock.Mock()`**: The `Mock` class is used to create mock objects. More info can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#the-mock-class).
3. **`capsys.readouterr()`**: This is a method provided by the `capsys` fixture in pytest, which captures writes to `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` and returns a named tuple with `out` and `err` attributes. More info can be found [here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/capture.html#accessing-captured-output-from-a-test-function).
4. **`mockDatastore.export_entities.call_args`**: This retrieves the arguments with which `export_entities` method of the `mockDatastore` object was called. It's part of the `unittest.mock` library's functionality. More info can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#unittest.mock.Mock.call_args).

The test function `test_datastore_export` is structured to:
- Prepare a mock event and context.
- Mock the Datastore client used in the `ds_export_cf` module.
- Call the `datastore_export_entities` function of the `ds_export_cf` module.
- Capture and examine the output to ensure the function behaves as expected, particularly checking that the `output_url_prefix` in the export request is set to the correct bucket URL.
